# AntiLog
A PaperMC plugin that helps prevent combat logging.

When a player logs off, an armor stand is spawned.  
If during the next minute, the armor stand is broken, the player's items are dropped on the ground.
When they log in, they will be killed.

### Commit history is currently screwed up, will fix soon:tm:

## FULL DISCLAIMER: This plugin was made in less than an hour, and probably has many bugs
